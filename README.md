# IndoStereoset Annotation (local scaffold)

This repository now contains a minimal Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold and the `App` converted from your `annotation_app (5).tsx` file.

How to run locally

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes
- The UI uses Tailwind-like classes but Tailwind is not configured in this scaffold. You can either keep using the utility classes (they'll have no effect) or add Tailwind following the Tailwind docs.
- If you want I can add Tailwind configuration and wire it up.
