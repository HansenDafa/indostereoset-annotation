# IndoStereoset Annotation (local scaffold)

This repository now contains a minimal Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold and the `App` converted from your `annotation_app (5).tsx` file.

How to run locally

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).

Notes
- Tailwind CSS is configured in this scaffold (files added: `tailwind.config.cjs`, `postcss.config.cjs`, and Tailwind directives are included in `src/index.css`). After you run `npm install`, Vite will process Tailwind automatically.
- If you want a custom theme or to add Tailwind plugins, I can update `tailwind.config.cjs` accordingly.
